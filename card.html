                Dear Tamah,<br><br>

                Happy 25th Wedding Anniversary babe!  As you can see from the photos, we made (and continue to make) a lovely couple.  I hope that some of the photo's will bring back some great memories of all the things we have done, the places we have been and even some of the hardships we have endured.<br><br>

                I am forever grateful that you accepted my proposal of marriage all those years ago, atop the tower at kings park.  I still remember it like it was yesterday.  I could never have forseen what lay ahead for us, but getting away and forging our own identity in the Kimberley I think was a great move and has held us in great stead all these years since.<br><br>

                The trip across the Nullabor to the Eastern States, the three holidays to Bali and our little adventure in Paris to see the Eiffel tower, Arc de Triumph (with snow) and Notre Dame to name a few have been such amazing highlights in our marriage journey.<br><br>

                To have had four children with you as well seems surreal.  Each one a part of you and me and yet so unique.  We have been truly blessed with our kids.  Even the baby that didn't make it we will see one day in heaven which is something else to look forward to.<br><br>

                Please know how much I truly love you and I think you are an amazing woman, mother, wife, daughter, sister to all those who know and love you. I have loved the past 25 years with you and sincerely hope that we will get another 25 years to grow old together, experience life and watch our children flourish in the future.<br><br>

                Love always, your adoring husband.<br><br>
                Ash xxxxoooo
